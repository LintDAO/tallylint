## Key Features
### Manage Tax Info
TaxLint is designed to help users who use ICP more easily count and manage their tax information. With taxlint, users will be able to record, track and calculate tax information related to their transactions and assets in the IC ecosystem.
### Auto Calculate Tax Result
Our main goal is to provide users in the IC ecosystem with a convenient tax management tool to help them move away from tedious manual statistics to easier automated statistics, thereby improving their tax payment experience and reducing error rates. This will improve user confidence in the use of IC and increase ICP user stickiness.
