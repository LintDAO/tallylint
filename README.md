## Code transparency on mainnet :üíé We seriously respect that (Thanks to consensus protocol)

We make sure all the code running on ic mainnet is what you see , what you get.  
For user to check code transparency ,
just one command will run all stuff and check for you :

```sh
# assume you already have docker installed in your machine~
docker run  btwl/taxlint:v1
```

### Reproducible steps:

We use docker container to remain all codes and its dependencies and environment.  
Here is the Dockerfile:

Current running canister code Module hash:  
running this will show module hash :

```sh
dfx canister status --network ic --wallet vwfus-yaaaa-aaaag-qcj2a-cai backend | grep "Module hash" | awk '{ print $3 }'
```

frontend hash:  
`0x1286960c50eb7a773cfb5fdd77cc238588f39e21f189cc3eb0f35199a99b9c7e`

`0x17ea3f0714b9df0316c73609dbad90827bb2d8359a683591fcc79844cab2530b`

## Developer

backend: by running the script to download tallylint source code and prepare backend development enviroment and for you.

```bash
wget  https://github.com/TaxLintDAO/taxlint/raw/master/reproducible/prep_backend_dev_env.sh
wget  https://github.com/TaxLintDAO/taxlint/raw/master/reproducible/continue_prep_env.sh

chmod 644 ./continue_prep_env.sh
./prep_backend_dev_env.sh
```

(if you dont have `wget` in your terminal yet. please install it .if you use ubuntu would be `apt update && apt install wget -y `)

### deploy backend

`./backend/scripts/deploy_backend <mode>`  
`mode` input local(run `dfx start` before) or ic

## Frontend install

Because [DAB.js](https://github.com/bitfinity-network/DAB-js) is used in order to support NFT, you need to perform the following steps when installing the dependency to confirm completion:

### Interaction guide

To pull and install from [@Psychedelic](https://github.com/psychedelic) via the NPM CLI, you'll need:

- A Github account
- A Github personal access token (you can create a personal acess token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
- The personal access token with the correct scopes, **repo** and **read:packages** to be granted access to the [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).
- Authentication via `npm login`, using your Github email for the **username** and the **personal access token** as your **password**:

Once you have those ready, run:

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@psychedelic
```

> **Note:** You only need to configure this once to install the package!

    On npm login provide your Github email as your username and the Personal access token as the password.

You can also setup your npm global settings to fetch from the Github registry everytime it finds a **@Psychdelic** package, find the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-your-registry-settings-as-an-npm-enterprise-user).

‚ö†Ô∏è Alternatively, a token could be passed to the `.npmrc` as `//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=xxxxxx` but we'd like to keep it clean and tokenless.

---

then: run `npm -i` before run `dfx deploy assets`
