Itest here is fully running local with simulation.
Run linux binary codes.
such as rust codes and wasm code.

"! Independent with same folder level of canisters."

to do Itest,
we need:

example:
compare with dfx: 
dfx : 
(hiding stuff is ic-env and caller )
dfx call backend greet "alex"  

abstactions:

env for ic-replica
    a exsting caniser running on repica(just running it . no much changes)
        (changing stuffs. )
        canister name 
        canister wasm file
        did file for api? maybe? 

a caller (by ic agent)
    method_name and args(with datatype)

any log on local?
